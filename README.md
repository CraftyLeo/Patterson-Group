# Patterson-Group

Welcome to the Patterson Group's GitHub! This is the home for the codebase for our experiments, as well as our relevant CAD files for machining. The GitHub is structured as follows: the experimental section holds all of our code relevant to running our current experiments; the CAD section holds all of our relevant CAD files; the readings section is intended to share our previous work for interested group members; each of these sections will be broken down into relevant folders based on the year or relevant experiments. 


The GitHub is currently a work in development, but expect more updates to come soon. 

## Experimental Code 

Break down into sub sections here. 

## CAD Files 

This folder is currently broken down into relevant quarters and between completed and uncompleted projects. 

## Readings

Explain whats going on here later.
