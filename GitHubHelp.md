# Trouble getting GitHub set up? Here are a few easy steps that even a physicist can understand

## Getting started with GitHub
1. First, create a GitHub Account where it says sign up. (Make sure you save your login and passkey recovery info for future use)
2. Second, install GitHub Desktop and sign in there! It is an easy interface for pushing and pulling code from the GitHub.
3. Once GitHub Desktop is installed, clone this repository to your computer. What this does is create a copy of this whole repo on your computer, which you can edit and update.

## Contributing Code to the GitHub
Now you are ready to contribute code and upload files to GitHub. Before you do anything, I always like to make sure my repository is up to date. The way you do this is by opening the app and selecting this repository in the upper left corner, and then fetching the origin.
This will give you the most updated set of code and files, and then you can subsequently press pull, which will copy the files to wherever you saved the repository on your computer. 
We do this to avoid mismatching versions and not overwriting the same files as another person, making any new contributions you make incompatible. 

Now you are all set to make changes or upload files to our GitHub. Once you have gone through and made your changes locally using whatever code editor you like, I personally like VS code, you are now ready to 'push' (or update) your code. 

To push your code, you can follow these steps: 
1. Make sure all of your files are saved on your computer, if they are not saved they will not push any new changes since your last save.
2. Next, you need to commit these changes, which you can do by using the bottom left corner of your GitHub app. It is usually best practice to say what changes you made, but usually a few words are plenty.
3. Now all you have to do is press the push button and let the code update on the website. This will allow for everyone to see the updates online after they pull.


## Troubleshooting Errors 
There are many possible errors when working with GitHub. Typically, a quick Google search will give you an easy answer, but these are my best fixes for some of the more common ones that I have experienced. 

### Large Files 
If you happen to upload a large file, you can deselect when you are committing if it is too big for the git. This will avoid adding it to your commit but will keep it in your same file path if that is important for a script you are running there

### Deleted Files 
If you also happen to delete a file and push this deletion, no worries! It is easy enough for us to fix by going back into the GitHub History and restoring the older version of these files. 

### File mismatch 
If you also happen to pull too late and the file has already been changed, you can also keep your version saved, but I recommend saving it as a copy and merging the two versions by hand if they have been changed significantly. But remember to pull to avoid this error!
